Second marker meeting.\\\\
\textbf{Feedback}
Following the meeting it was agreed that the project would be based around the creation of a testing mechanism instead of being solely performance based the thesis work to this point was said to be under what was expected however as the project aims shifted this allowed less changes to be made overall there was also guidance on existing projects within the university.


\subsection{Meetings up to 21/3/16}
There has been a lack of formal communication with weekly updates being discussed at any point where we happened to meet however there has been no meetings recently this is due to the absence of my supervisor.    

\subsection{Meeting 9 21/3/17}
This meeting was a review of the dissertation to this point carried out  after the meeting constructive feedback on structure and progress of the dissertation was given also a discussion of testing the finished project took place.
