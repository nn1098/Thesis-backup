\begin{abstract}
As games evolve and expand with the times there is an increased demand placed upon the hardware of games consoles and personal computers in terms of storage space and memory usage. This project will analyse the approaches currently available and will examine the viability of developing a combined approach to level generation and path finding with the aim of producing a solution that will compete with current approaches in terms of the quality of the terrain generated tested through the results given by the path finding and the distances between nodes that will be placed in sane (flat, reachable) locations on the terrain this will also allow for testing the quality of the path finding approach by testing against different complexities of terrain and existing industry techniques.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Computer Graphics}
Firstly before we discuss the main techniques that will be use within the project we will give a background of computer graphics techniques that will be utilised in the project as a basis for anyone without prior knowledge.\\\\Computer graphics entails the process of drawing visuals to a screen using the graphics card of a computer the main technologies that allow this functionality include OpenGl (Open Graphics Library) and Microsoft's\textsuperscript(tm) DirectX framework. 

\subsection{Procedural Level Generation}
Procedural level generation is the process of creating a level through an algorithm contained within a computer program instead of using software to create this content then loading it into a program. The procedural level generation approach was mainly utilised in the early day of games development where storage space was a major concern.\\The first game to contain procedurally generated levels was Richard Garriott's  game Akalabeth: World of Doom which was published by California Pacific Computer Company in 1980 \cite{Akalabeth}.\\\\This project is going to utilise procedural level generation to create a average sized game world by creating a height-map which is a grey-scale image then reading the data from a height-map and using this data against the depth buffer of a graphics programming language to generate the world.

\subsection{Path-Finding}
Path-Finding is an area of Artificial Intelligence that allows for definition what parts of a given level can be moved to by computer controlled players this is done by creating a set of nodes on walkable areas then linking these nodes together to form a path there are various algorithms that accomplish this task. A time-line of path-finding developments is given at figure: \ref{timeline}. The project will attempt to use path-finding on the generated level in small chunks to allow for faster processing and access to more optimisation techniques.  
\subsection{Optimisation Techniques}
There are many factors that can affect the run-time performance of computer programs and a similar amount of approaches that can be utilised to improve performance some of the most prominent techniques in this area include use of multi-threading and parallelism frameworks such as OpenMP for use in single computer based solutions and MPI which allows for parallel implementation over a network.

There are other options that differ from a parallel approach that could be utilised these can include memory alignment of instructions or parallelisation of the project through CPU based frameworks such as OpenMP or for greater performance a graphics processing unit (GPU) based implementation.      

\subsection{Aims and Objectives}
\label{Aims}
The main aim of this project is to examine and test the viability of combining level generation and path finding algorithms to create a double ended testing mechanism for quality to allow a performance based assessment between both level of detail in the terrain when compared with the time taken for a path finding technique to find a correct path.\\\\
   The aim of this project will be achieved by completion of the following objectives which include both design and implementation as shown below.
   
   \subsubsection{Design objective}
   The main design objective will be the creation of a graphical user interface that provides a suitable visualisation of the implemented solution and displays all relevant data. There are various libraries that allow for and assist with the creation of such interfaces such as GLFW for Opengl based applications however the windows SDK also contains this ability and will allow for clear differentiation from the interface and any graphical code included in the application.  
   
   \subsubsection{Implementation Objectives}
    The creation of an application using the chosen solution to allow a user to create various sizes of level.\\\\ The application will then build the terrain and perform path finding on a set of nodes positioned across a generated terrain.\\\\ The application will then assess the quality of both the level generated by  and path finding technique taking into account the complexity of a given level such as obstacles slopes and caves.\\\\The application will then assess how easy it is to build a path round that level and will give a score based on both the complexity of a generated level and the path-finding technique used.\\ 


\subsection{Report Layout}
The report goes on to give a review of various literature sources associated with the project Next there will be an analysis into the methodology used in implementation and finally the testing and results will be given alongside a conclusion to the project which will discuss the overall success and knowledge gained based on the results of testing.

\section{Technical Information}
This section will look at the hardware based issues with the project and will show updates to hardware utilisation.


\newpage
\section{Implementation Methodology}
This section will analyse how the different areas of the implementation are approached and seek to explain how these approaches work at a technical level.

For a basic outline of the expected execution of the project please refer to figure \ref{block}
\subsection{Level Generation}
To generate the three dimensional terrain used in the project a height-map was generated through the use of the Libnoise external library which is discussed below.

\subsubsection{Libnoise external library}
This external library generates different types of noise as shown by figure \ref{noise} this is achieved use of various modules that can produce different types of noise including Perlin which is the basis for our output shown in \ref{heightmap} another feature of this library is that it allows the noise generated to be written out to various graphical file types for the height-map in the project a Bitmap (BMP) graphical file type was produced which is then loaded into the project and stored in a data structure for manipulation and rendering.\\
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/heightmaptest}
	\caption{An image showing the output image that was generated by noise}	 \label{noise}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak
When this image is rendered to the screen against a depth buffer on the GPU it gives the following output:
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/Heightmap-output}
	\caption{The output from rendering a heightmap} \label{heightmap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Nodes and placement} 
To place and visualise the nodes that will be utilised for any path finding technique to be used across a terrain. The glut (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) api was used to create a simple method for rendering a sphere these were then placed along the x and z axis of the terrain and position on the y-axis is checked against the height values read in from the height-map to either raise or lower the nodes to suit the terrain. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/nodes}
	\caption{The node placement when drawn on to the terrain} \label{node}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Path finding implementation}
To allow comparison between different path finding techniques we will implement both Dijkstra's algorithm and A-star when a path is found the nodes that make up the path will change from red \ref{node} to green.  

\subsection{Combining the terrain and path-finding metric}
When it comes to the combination of measurements gathered by the project our first concern is what exactly we are measuring which for the path-finding will be the distance of path from start to finish and the time taken to build a path across the terrain.\\\\To measure the quality of terrain we will look at the standard deviation of the normals and time taken to generate a suitable terrain now to combine these timing measurements is fine as they will be on the same scale.\\\\ There is an issue when deciding how we measure the distance of a path against the standard deviation of the normals on the terrain as these will be scaled differently now there are a few options here firstly we could take lots of path-finding measurements and by working out how much difference there is between these we could establish a scale that would be able to integrate with the standard deviation of the terrain.      


\subsection{Additional Information / Knowledge Required}
To implement the project a solid knowledge of a graphical programming language such as openGL or DirectX is required also perfomance based GPGPU programming API's  such as OpenCL or Nvidia's CUDA could be useful for optimising the project.

The artificial intelligence aspects of the project will require knowledge of various path-finding techniques and also an understanding of machine based learning would be beneficial to allow training of the system for analysis of the terrain and path-finding metric.   
\subsection{Experimental plan}
To determine how well the project works in terms of creating a combined metric for terrain generation and path-finding the following experiments will be run.

\subsubsection{Experiment 1}
For this experiment the aim is to gather the results of both path-finding techniques over a single terrain generated using one type of noise this will allow verification of the path finding techniques and leading on to the integration of a combined metric. 

\subsubsection{Experiment 2}
This experiment will use different instances of terrain generated using various types of noise and both path-finding techniques this will allow testing of the combined metric and show that the project can be utilised in a variety of scenarios.

\subsubsection{After experiment 2} 
As experiment two concludes this will show how the project meets with the aims laid out above \ref{Aims} following on from here the main focus will be to increase the run time performance of the project and to generalise the implementation to increase the area's in which the project can be applied.
